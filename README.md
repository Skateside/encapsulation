# Encapsulation

A collection of functions and scripts that help explain encapsulation. There
are complementary blog posts that explain these scripts better:

- [Part 1: Overview](http://sk80.co.uk/2016/01/encapsulation-part-1-overview/)
- Part 2: Collections
- Part 3: Objects

The links for the remaining parts will be added as the blog posts are published.
